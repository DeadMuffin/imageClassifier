This is still work in progress with messy Code and bad variable naming.
It is currently public because some people I know want to take a quick look.


Getting started.
clone repository with "git clone https://github.com/DeadMuffin/imageClassifier.git"
Make sure to have python installed.
Use pip to install nessessary packages:
"pip install tkinter"
"pip install opencv-python"
"pip install Pillow"
"pip install scikit-learn"
"pip install numpy"

start the program with: python main.py


Good to know.
Folder1 is for images without potholes. You need to provide these images by hand or you can create new in the gui.
Folder2 is for images with potholes. You need to provide these images by hand or you can create new in the gui.
Currently you need pictures in the 1920x1080 format. After that you can use the umbennenUndVerkleinern.py to scale and format the pictures in the needed form. Folder1 and 2 Are the trainingdata for your model.
Folder3 is for divers images with and without. You can test the model later with these images.
Results will appear when you test the model. It gives more insights about how the model succeeds.

You ve got this :)
